# Bid Wars

Bid Wars is a simple command-line auction program written in Python. It allows multiple bidders to enter their names and bid amounts, and then determines the winner with the highest bid.

## Features

- Multiple bidders can enter their information
- Clears the screen between bids for privacy
- Determines and announces the winner with the highest bid

## How to Use

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter the name and bid amount for each bidder when prompted.
3. After each bid, indicate whether there are more bidders.
4. When all bids are in, the program will announce the winner.

## Code Structure

The program consists of three main parts:

1. `highest(dic)`: A function that determines the highest bidder from a dictionary of bids.
2. `looping()`: A function that prints newline characters to clear the screen.
3. The main loop: Handles user input and program flow.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
